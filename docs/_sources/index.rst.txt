Welcome to OSI Validator's documentation!
=========================================

The OSI Validator recursively checks the compliance of an OSI message of type
`SensorData`, `SensorView` or `GroundTruth` according to predefined or
personalized rules.

The basic requirements for OSI 3 are gathered in the
`KPIs documentation <./KPIs/index.html>`_.
